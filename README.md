Using JSON Snippets in Visual Studio Code
This repository contains JSON snippets that can be used in Visual Studio Code to enhance your development workflow. JSON snippets provide a convenient way to insert commonly used code templates or snippets with just a few keystrokes.

Getting Started
To use the JSON snippets in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed on your computer. If you don't have it, you can download it from the official website.

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the folder where you have cloned or downloaded this repository.

Open the html.code-snippets file, which contains the JSON snippets for HTML files.

Copy the contents of the html.code-snippets file.

In Visual Studio Code, go to File -> Preferences -> User Snippets.

Select the "html" language option.

If you already have an existing html.json file, open it. Otherwise, create a new file with the name html.json.

Paste the contents you copied from the html.code-snippets file into the html.json file.

Save the html.json file.

Using the JSON Snippets
Once you have added the JSON snippets, you can start using them in your HTML files. Here's how:

Open an HTML file in Visual Studio Code.

To insert a snippet, type the specified prefix and press the Tab key. For example, to insert the "htm" snippet, type "htm" and press Tab.

The corresponding HTML code snippet will be inserted at the current cursor position.

Customize the inserted snippet as needed, such as modifying text, adding attributes, or deleting unnecessary elements.

Continue coding and enjoy the improved development experience with these JSON snippets!
